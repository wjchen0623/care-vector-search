Medical Education Event Kuala Lumpur | Spine Surgeons Kuala Lumpur
On 16th April, not only we had the liberty to enjoy talks from Dr Lim Sze Wei, Consultant Orthopaedic, Spine & Trauma Surgeon, and Dato' Dr Badrul Shah Badaruddin, Consultant Orthopaedic, Arthritis & Sports Surgeon, but we also managed to introduce our new brand and services, together with GP Agility program to all stakeholders!
Right after, we had Q&A session over an amazing dinner and ended the day with Kahoot quiz!
We're glad that the event went very well and received positive feedback from all attendees. Hitting our first-ever milestone, we hope to continue this effort as part of our commitment towards providing agile care hand-in-hand with our GPs
