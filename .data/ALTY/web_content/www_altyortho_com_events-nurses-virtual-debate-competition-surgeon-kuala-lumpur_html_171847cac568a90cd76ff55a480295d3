Set a goal, be brave and speak out loud
In conjunction with International Nurses Day last week, we had an in-house virtual debate competition among our nurses. The debate topic focused on how Covid-19 infection is disrupting medical care due to deaths among nurses and healthcare workers.
Our highest appreciation goes to the Ward Nurses and Operating Theatre Nurses for their critical thinking, hard work and effort to participate in the competitive debate.
