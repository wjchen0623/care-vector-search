'Adding Life to Years' or ALTY is dedicated to providing every patient with the right treatment at the right time. As our name suggests, we want to ensure that patients can live with greater comfort and ease of movement, thereby adding quality years to their lives. We do this by providing specific care to each patient.
With that in mind, we aim to efficiently diagnose the cause of your discomfort and provide optimal solutions through our Spine and Joint Clinics. Additionally, we offer comprehensive screening services under ALTY Screening, our established screening centre, providing accurate and efficient early detection and prevention of health problems.
We specialise in surgical and non-surgical treatments and provide focused care for Orthopaedic and Musculoskeletal conditions, among our other medical specialties under one roof. ALTY is also equipped with facilities that aid in the functional recovery of patients, on top of Malaysia√¢s first-ever weight-bearing MRI and EOS Imaging System.
