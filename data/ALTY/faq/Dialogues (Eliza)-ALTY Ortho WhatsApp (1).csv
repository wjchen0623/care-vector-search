What you need to prepare for the appointment:

1. Patient need to be fasting at least 4-6 hours before the MRI/CT scan. No fasting needed for XRay/US. 

2. Blood test result is required to determine the patient’s kidney function. If the patient has done any blood test 6 months prior, it is usable. If not, the patient will need to do a blood test first either from outside lab or in ALTY.

3. Patient should inform if he/she has any past history with contrast allergy or has any allergy with any type of food or medicine. Pre-medication will be given prior to contrast injection in order to prevent severe allergic reaction.

4. If contrast is ordered, it will be given via injection through the IV line. It is very safe and non-drowsy.""
